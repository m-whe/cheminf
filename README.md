Simple cheminformatics workflows
by Michael He

I've included two python workflows in this repository.

>1. smiles-to-inchi.py
>2. CHEBMLid-to-smiles.py

1. smiles-to-inchi.py returns .csv file with new column of inchi_keys generated from canonical SMILES strings

2. CHEMBLid-to-smiles.py returns .xml query results file and .csv file of canonical SMILES from ChEMBL ID using the CHEMBL API

Each workflow has instructions at the top of the file.
